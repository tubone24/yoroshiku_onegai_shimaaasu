Let's play on this page.

## What is this?

In the movie "Summer Wars," there is a scene where the main character Kenji Koiso (小磯健二) receives a mysterious sequence of numbers, which he solves in one night, resulting in a serious problem.

The cipher that he used was RSA cipher, and he was able to factorize a huge number of digits in one night.

As an aside. In Japan, during reruns of Summer Wars, everyone yells `Yes, please!` (よろしくお願いしまぁぁぁすっ!!).

## Technical side

This program challenges you to solve RSA cryptography by using [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) and launching WebAssembry created by Rust on your browser.

Therefore, there is no need for a server for the calculation. It would be a shame if everyone had to run such a heavy script.
